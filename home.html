            <p> <center>  we are from south Indian State of Kerala.</center> Precisely Alleppey 
                district known as Venice of the east, and our village
                 is famous for world famous writer Thakazhy shivashankar 
                 Pillai.The village name is Thakazhy. <p>
                During 19th century portuguese where ruling a small 
                south indian kingdom called Purakad. It was a 
                famous port town for spices export at that time.</p> <br>
                 Later portuguese had a treaty arrengement with 
                neighbouring country called Chembakashery and later
                 they handed over their kingdom to Chembakashery 
                and merged with it. In the treaty arrangement 
                portuguese agreed to train the Chembakashery military 
                with arms and ammunition. It was that time a modern weopon. </p><br>
                <p>
                As part of the agreement the Chembakashery king has
                 told them to settle down the officers
