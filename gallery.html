                this temple the deity faces to east dide with wife and son. There are 5 poojas in a day. There are no sub deities.
               There is a belief about the formation of this temple. The idol in this temple was once installed on a hill named
                'Othar' ,by Lord Parasurama. But the idol reached in an agricultural farm because of a heavy flood. 
                A magician(Odiyan)in that place found out the idol and gave it to 'Vilwamangalam Swami' for installation. But 
                'Vilwamangalam' realized the supernatural power of the idol and gave 
               it to a sage named 'Udhayarkkan'. That sage installed the idol and the king of 'Chembakassery' built a temple there.</div>
